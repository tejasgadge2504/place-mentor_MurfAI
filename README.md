## About

**Placementor** is a next-generation **voice-first interview training platform** designed to help users practice, improve, and perfect their interview performance.  Placementor is **powered by** by integrating:

✅ **Murf Falcon TTS** for ultra-natural, real-time question narration  
✅ **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** for live conversational interaction  
✅ **AI Agents** for adaptive question generation & feedback  

This transforms Placementor from a text-based prep tool into a **fully conversational AI interview mentor.**

## Why Voice-First?

IRL Interview depend on your communication skills. There are very few platforms where you can actually practice your communication skills with questions specific to your target company.

Using Murf Falcon + ASR, Placementor now simulates a **real interview room**:  
- You *hear* the interviewer (Murf Falcon)  
- You *speak* the answer (ASR)  
- You *receive* instant, structured feedback (AI Agents)  

This enables:
- More immersive prep  
- Better vocal confidence  
- Practice under real interview pressure  
- Training for tone, clarity, and speaking patterns

## How Murf Falcon Enhances Experience

Murf Falcon was a **crucial upgrade** to elevate the realism of the interview simulation:

- **Low-latency TTS** enables fluid back-and-forth exchanges  
- **Stable API output** allowed seamless integration with Flask backend  
- **Reduced cognitive load** for users—users focus on answers instead of reading text  

This made the project’s shift to **voice-first AI** not just possible, but truly powerful.

## Why This Project Stands Out (Winning Angle)

### **1. Fully Voice-First Experience**
A seamless loop of **listen → speak → analyze → respond**, powered by **Murf Falcon + ASR**.

### **2. Hyper-Realistic Interview Simulation**
Tone-balanced **Falcon voices** create real HR/technical interview dynamics.

### **3. Modular Dual-Agent Architecture**
- **Murf Falcon** handles narration  
- **AI Agents** handle question planning & feedback  
A future-ready foundation for multi-agent interoperability.

### **4. High-Impact Real-World Use Case**
Solves a major pain point for millions of **students and job-seekers**.

### **5. Scalable & Extensible**
Future enhancements include:
- Multiple voice personalities  
- Mock HR stress testing  
- Multilingual interview modes  
- Company-specific interview packs  
- Behavioral + technical + system design rounds
